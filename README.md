# Monster-Hunter
A C# game consisting of a library that can be accessed both from a console app and a Windows app to play the same game.

This project is a C# windows application intended to demonstrate my ability to separate 
Model, Control, and View by creating a game where all the game logic is contained in a DLL library. 
The project includes two versions of the game, one as a console application and the other as a Windows Forms application, 
both using the same DLL library. However, the Windows Forms version was not completed. 
This project highlights my understanding of the Model-View-Controller architecture 
and my ability to develop game logic that can be used across multiple platforms.
